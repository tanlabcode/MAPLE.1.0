# MethylPredict
An R package for predicting gene activity level for single cell DNA Methylation data

MethylPredict is a supervised learning algorithm that is developed the predict the gene activity levels of individual cells from single cell DNA Methylation. It is implemented in R programming language and uses CpG methylation sites in promoter regions to infer gene activity.
